Question 3
A part of the Java program is given, which can be completed in many ways, for example using the concept of thread, etc.  Follow the given code and complete the program so that your program prints the message “NPTEL Java week-6 new Assignment Q3”. Your program should utilize the given interface/ class.

Solution:

// Class MyThread extends B and overrides run()

    synchronized void print(int n) {
        for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
            System.out.println(n * i);
            try {
                Thread.sleep(400);
            } catch (Exception e) {
                System.out.println(e);
            }
